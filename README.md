# OOP-Assignment

This repository contains solutions for an Object-Oriented Programming assignment in Python.

Question 1: Encapsulation using an `Invoice` class.
Question 2: Inheritance with a base class `Security` and derived classes `Stock`, `Bond`, and `Option`.
Question 4: A program that checks if one number is a multiple of another, running until the user enters `-`.

Each question is organized in a separate folder for clarity.
